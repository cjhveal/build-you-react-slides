# Build you a React
## With Cody Veal &amp; Gigster

---

# React?

React is an open source library developed by Facebook for building reactive user interfaces

---

# Reactive Programming

- Declare structure of data flow.

- Automaticallly propagate changes.

- For example: Spreadsheets.

???

Reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm
in which you define static relationships and structure between your inputs
and when the data changes, it is propagated throughout the system by design.

---

# Reactive UI

- Declare interface structure given an application state

- Updating application state updates the interface.

???

Very similar to the server request-response cycle.

---

# How Else Has It Been Done?

- Direct Document Manipulation (jQuery)

--

- MVC Architecture (Angular, Ruby on Rails, etc).

---

# Direct DOM Manipulation

```js
  $('.increment-button').on('click', function() {
    var count = $('.counter').text() + 1;
    $('.counter').text(count);

    if (count >= 5) {
      $('.counter').css('color', 'red');
    }
  })
```

---

# What's Wrong?

--

- Couples representation of state with presentation

--

- Must manually manage propagation of UI updates from events.

---

# Model View Controller

- Model handles internal representation of state

--

- View handles user-facing presentation of state

--

- Controller sends messages between and manipulates both.

---

# Model View Controller

![MVC](mvc.png)

---

# What's Wrong?

- Bi-directional communication between components makes it difficult to trace execution.

--

- Two way binding to application state leads to strange cascading events at scale.

--

- However, concerns are better separated than the previous example.

---

# What's Wrong?

.right[![MVC Scale](mvc-scale.png)]

---

# Motivations for React

- Simplicity

--

- Flexibility

--

- Predictability

--

- Not necessarily Performance (but it helps)

???

One of the React core contributors wrote that Performance was not a reason that React was used,
but more a requirement for the reactive paradigm to be used.

---

# Reactive UI at a High Level

- Virtual DOM enables manipulation of light weight Javascript objects rather than DOM nodes.

--

- Data flows from the top of the application downwards.

--

- All changes to data are done through structured mutations that pass the results back through to the root.

---

# A Naive approach

- When the state changes, replace the entire UI with a copy.

---

# What is the DOM?

--

- **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel.

--

- Imperative programming interface to a document structure.

---

# Anatomy of the DOM

The DOM is a tree structure of nodes called `Element`s
which take the form the form:

```html
<ul id="abc">
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
</ul>
```
--

`ul`, `li`: tag names

--

`id="abc"`: attributes

--

`<li>1</li>`, `<li>2</li>`: children

--

`1`, `2`: `TextNode`

---

# What's wrong with the DOM?

- Imperative implies hard to reactively propagate changes.

- Programming interface is cumbersome and ugly.

---

# a Solution: Virtual DOM

- declarative description of the DOM in JavaScript.

---

# Document Object Model model

We'll introduce a few types to model the DOM:

- `VElem`: a virtual DOM Element
- `VText`: a virtual text node
- `VTree`: a slice of the virtual document tree.

---
# Virtual DOM Types

```js
VTree = (VText | VElem);

VText = {
  text: String,
};

VElem = {
  tag: String,
  props: Object<String, String|Function>,
  children: Array<VTree>
};
```
---

# Event Handlers

`VElem` event handlers are passed in as props that begin with the letters 'on' and have `Function` values.

for instance, a prop passed in as 'onclick' should be attached to the 'click' event on the `Element`.

---

# Implementation

https://github.com/cjhveal/build-you-react

---

# Implementation

1. VText constructor
2. VElem constructor
3. VText render
4. VElem render
5. Hyperscript Helper
6. Mount Helper

---

# VText constructor

```js
function VText(text: String): VText {
  // implement me!
}
```
---

# VElem constructor

```js
function VElem(
  tag: String,
  props: Object<String, String>,
  children: Array<VText|VElem>
) {
  // implement me!
}
```
---

# VText render

Builds a DOM `TextNode` from our VText object.

```js
VText.prototype.render = function() : TextNode {
  // implement me!
}
```

See `document.createTextNode(text)` for the DOM `TextNode` constructor.

---

# VElem render

Builds a DOM `Element` from a `VElem` Object. Should recursively render any children to native DOM, too.

```
VElem.prototype.render = function() : Element {
  // implement me!
}
```

See `document.createElement(tagName)` to create a native DOM `Element`.

See `element.setAttribute(name, value)` and `element.addEventListener(eventName, handler)` for attaching props.

See `element.appendChild(childNode)` for attaching children.

---

# Hyperscript Helper

The hyperscript helper `el` will instantiate a `VElem`, allow you to exclude empty prop objects, and
convert any string children to `VText` automatically.

A basic reference implementation is provided.

---

# Mount Helper

The mount helper `mount` will let us render a virtual tree into a native DOM element

A reference implementation is provided.

---

# Unidirectional Data Flow

- A pattern that really synergizes with React's other strengths.

--

- The basic idea is that your entire application state is stored in a single tree separate from your component state.

--

- Mutations are dispatched through handlers in the Components, and the resulting updated state is passed through to the top of the application.

--

- Popular implementations are the Facebook backed Flux and spin-off Redux.

---

# Unidirectional Data Flow

.center[![Unidirectional Flow Chart](data-flow.png)]

---

# State Container Types

```js
State = Any

Action = (getState) => State

Store = {
  getState: () => State,
  actions: Object<String, Action>
}
```

---

# Store Constructor

```js
function Store(
  initialState: State,
  actions: Object<String, Action>,
  onStateSet: (Store) => ()
) {
  // implement me!
}

Store.prototype.getState = function() : State {
  // implement me!
}

```
---

# Components

Components are light wrappers over a render function that expose them to the application state.

```js
function Component(renderFn : (Store) => VTree) {

}

Component.prototype.render = function(store: Store) : Element {

}
```

---

# Implementation P2

1. Implement Stores.

2. Modify render methods to take a Store and pass it through to all children.

3. Implement Components.

---

# Reconciliation

- DOM nodes are heavyweight and stateful

--

- Very wasteful to recreate the entire UI on every state change.

--

- **Solution**: Reconciliation.

---

# General Tree Diffing

- What's the complexity of finding a minimal edit script between two trees?

--

- Finding a minimal edit script to transform one tree to another is solvable in O(n^3)
w.r.t. the number of nodes. This has been proven optimal.

--

- However, even modest applications can contain 1000s of nodes.

--

- Updates must be realtime, ideally less than 16.67ms

???

---

# React's Approach:

- React instead uses heuristics about how applications generally operate to reduce
the time complexity.

1. Components of the same type will likely generate similar trees,
components which differ by type will likely generate dissimilar trees.

2. It is often possible to unqiuely key elements in a stable manner across updates.

---

# High Level View:

1. Perform a depth first search on the tree, pairwise comparing previous and new nodes.
   Replacing entire subtree below when two nodes are of different types.

2. When two Nodes are of equal type, we find the difference in their props and children.
   While props difference is simply a Set difference, child diffing poses some issues.

---

# Subtree Re-Rendering

.center[![Subtree](subtree.png)]

---

# Naive Children Reconciliation.

In the general, unoptimized case, React takes a very simple approach:

- Iterate through the list pairwise comparing nodes.

- Replace nodes of different types and diff nodes of the same type.

- However, inserting an element at the beginning of the children array causes a signfiicant issue.

---

# Optimal Child Reconciliation.

- Finding a minimal edit script for a list can be solved via Levenshtein in `O(n^2)`.

- However, this will not be able to identify reorderings.
  Algorithms to do so have prohibitive complexity for our needs.

---

# Keys

- By providing a unique key value, we can build hashed indexes to efficiently perform
insertion, deletion, and replacement in linear time.
